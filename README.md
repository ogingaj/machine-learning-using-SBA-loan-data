# Predictive Modeling of SBA Loan Defaults and Economic Impact: A Machine Learning Approach

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict loan outcomes and assess the economic impact of Small Business Administration (SBA) guaranteed loans in the United States. Specifically, the study predicts loan repayment status, the likelihood of default, the charged-off principal amount, the number of jobs created, and the size of the disbursed loan.

Beyond the U.S. context, the findings offer transferable insights for development finance in emerging markets, particularly regarding default risk management and the role of credit access in job creation. The analysis seeks to uncover patterns that can inform strategies to improve credit accessibility, reduce systemic biases, and guide equitable, data-driven policy interventions.

# Research Questions:

1. What is the optimal loan amount to approve for a small business?

2. What predicts the size of the loan’s charged-off principal upon default?

3. What factors predict the number of jobs created through SBA guaranteed loans?

4. What predicts a loan’s repayment status?

5. What predicts the likelihood of a loan defaulting?

To address these questions, this study employs a range of machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machines (SVM). These approaches aim not only to enhance predictive accuracy but also to offer actionable insights for public sector finance and policy design.
